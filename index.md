Here is some code I wrote:
```
void PhysicsSystem::Update() {
    for (auto object : ObjectsWith<Transform>()) {
        object.GetComponent<Transform>().position += object.GetComponent<Transform>().velocity;
    }
}
```

## Section 3 (Actual Introduction)

I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) studying Computer Engineering in Jacob’s School of Engineering. After being introduced to the Scratch programming language in 4th grade, I followed my interest in computing throughout high school and into university, completing work inside and outside of school to pursue my passion.

I now have experience working comfortably with Java, C++, C, HTML, JavaScript, and more. I’ve enjoyed designing and implementing UI for large-scale applications such as Dolphin Emulator. At St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, I worked on cloud applications enabling researchers to share data. During my internship at OPTEVUS, an AI-powered hiring platform, I worked on machine learning algorithms in Python, also designing a tool for annotating large text-based datasets. I am always looking to expand my skillset and create new things.

Outside of computers, I enjoy making music, whether it be music production, DJing, or playing an instrument. I love staying active and finding new places to hike, skate, surf, or run.
